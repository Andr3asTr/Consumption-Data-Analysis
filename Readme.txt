This software demonstrates what an analyst could use to extract a power consumption report based on data given for a specific time period. It can quickly provide answers for questions like:
a) which time of day was the laundry room power consumption max?
b) what time period of the year / month was the power consumption for heat max / min?
c) does the power consumption of the kitchen change depending on the day of the week?

The data included are measurements per second so they are a lot. The analyst could therefore use the software to sum up the values or find for example the mean value of power consumption for a specific time period.

The reports that the software will export, based on what the analyst wants, can be in .txt (text file), .md (markdown) or .html(website).
